# 🏆 FIFA Analytics SQL Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing FIFA player and match data using **SQL Server**.  
The objective is to derive meaningful insights related to player performance, team dominance, scoring trends, and match outcomes using advanced SQL techniques.


## ❓ Problem Statement
Football analysts require data-driven insights to:
- Evaluate player performance and consistency
- Identify top goal contributors
- Analyze team dominance across matches
- Understand match-level scoring patterns

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **SQL Server**
- Relational Database Design
- Advanced SQL Queries
- Window Functions
- CTEs & Subqueries

---

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed
- Player performance ranking
- Goal and assist contribution analysis
- Player consistency using minutes played
- Match-level goal analysis
- Team-wise scoring trends (home & away)
- High goal difference match detection
- Discipline analysis using card data

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- High-rated players show consistent impact across matches.
- Goal contribution (goals + assists) is more meaningful than goals alone.
- Team performance analysis improves when home and away goals are combined.
- Running totals highlight consistent performers over time.
